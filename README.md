# .github — Organisation-Wide Configuration

This repository contains shared configuration and community health files
for the [lfreleng-actions](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions) GitHub
organisation (Linux Foundation Release Engineering).

Files placed here are automatically inherited by all repositories in the
organisation unless overridden at the repository level.

## Contents

### Organisation Profile

- **[`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md)** — The public-facing
  organisation profile displayed at
  [github.com/lfreleng-actions](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions).
  Contains a categorised directory of all actions, tools, and test
  fixtures in the organisation.

### Shared Configuration

- **[`release-drafter.yml`](release-drafter.yml)** — Organisation-wide
  [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)
  configuration. Provides default categories, autolabeler rules (mapping
  Conventional Commits prefixes to labels), and version-resolver settings.
  Any repository without its own `.github/release-drafter.yml` inherits
  this configuration automatically.

### Workflows

- **[`workflows/repo-audit.yaml`](workflows/repo-audit.yaml)** — Runs on
  a weekly schedule (Monday 08:00 UTC). Compares the current list of
  repositories in the organisation against the profile README and sends a
  Slack notification to `#releng-scm` when it finds new repositories
  that lack documentation or an explicit exclusion entry.
- **[`workflows/zizmor.yaml`](workflows/zizmor.yaml)** — Organisation-wide
  static security audit of GitHub Actions workflows and composite actions
  using [zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/). Runs on every pull request and
  push to `main`/`master`, uploads results to GitHub code scanning as
  SARIF, and runs in **advisory mode** (does not block merges). The
  workflow runs across the organisation as a *required workflow* via
  an organisation ruleset; see [Organisation-wide zizmor
  audit](#organisation-wide-zizmor-audit) below for the one-time
  org-admin configuration.

### Repository Exclusions

- **`excluded-repos.json`** — A JSON file listing repository names to
  exclude from the weekly audit. This covers forks of upstream
  actions, placeholder/template repositories not yet developed, and backup
  directories that are not real repositories.

## How It Works

### Release Drafter Inheritance

When a repository in the `lfreleng-actions` organisation runs the
`release-drafter/release-drafter` action and does **not** have its own
`.github/release-drafter.yml`, GitHub automatically falls back to the
configuration in this repository. The shared configuration uses the
`$OWNER/$REPOSITORY` template variables so that release notes, download
badges, and issue links resolve to the correct URLs for any inheriting
repository.

Repositories that need custom categories or version-resolver rules can
override the defaults by adding their own `.github/release-drafter.yml`.

### Organisation-wide zizmor audit

The `zizmor.yaml` workflow performs static security analysis of GitHub
Actions workflows and composite actions across every repository in the
organisation. It uses [zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/), which detects
common security defects including template-injection vulnerabilities,
credential persistence (`artipacked`), excessive permission scopes,
dangerous triggers (`pull_request_target`), unpinned `uses:` references,
and more.

#### Mode of operation

- **Output**: SARIF, uploaded to GitHub code scanning. Findings appear
  in each repository's **Security → Code scanning** tab and as inline
  PR annotations on the offending lines.
- **Severity floor**: `medium` (the workflow filters out informational
  and low findings to reduce noise).
- **Persona**: `regular` (zizmor's default; high-signal, low-noise).
- **Advisory**: zizmor exits `0` when emitting SARIF, so the workflow
  always reports success in the PR checks UI. Merge-blocking remains
  **disabled** at the workflow level on purpose. After the team
  triages the pre-existing finding backlog across the organisation, an
  org-level **code-scanning ruleset** can switch selected findings to
  merge-blocking (see *Promoting findings to merge-blocking* below).

#### One-time org-admin setup

Unlike `release-drafter.yml` (which GitHub auto-inherits from the
`.github` repository), workflow files in `.github/workflows/` are
**not** automatically run for other repositories. To execute
`zizmor.yaml` against every repository in the organisation without
copying it into each repo, configure it as a *required workflow* via
an organisation ruleset:

1. Go to **Organisation settings** →
   [**Repository → Rulesets**](https://github.com/organizations/lfreleng-actions/settings/rules)
   (you must be an organisation owner).
2. Click **New ruleset** → **New branch ruleset**.
3. Set:
   - **Ruleset name**: `zizmor security audit`
   - **Enforcement status**: `Active`
   - **Bypass list**: leave empty
   - **Target repositories**: `All repositories` (or use *Dynamic list
     of repositories* with property filters to limit scope; the
     initial rollout should target *All repositories*).
   - **Target branches**: `Default branch` (and `master` if you have
     repositories still using that name; or use `Include by pattern`
     with `main` and `master`).
4. Under **Rules**, enable **Require workflows to pass before merging**
   and click **Add workflow**:
   - **Repository**: `lfreleng-actions/.github`
   - **Workflow file path**: `.github/workflows/zizmor.yaml`
   - **Ref**: `main`
5. Leave **Do not require workflows to pass before merging** unchecked
   for now (SARIF output drives the advisory mode, not the ruleset).
   Switch this to *required* later, after the team clears the backlog.
6. Click **Create**.

After saving, every pull request opened in the organisation will
trigger a `zizmor` run sourced from `lfreleng-actions/.github`. The
checks appear in PRs as `Audit workflows and actions / zizmor`, and
findings populate the target repository's **Security → Code scanning**
tab.

#### Updating zizmor

The workflow pins `zizmor` to a specific PyPI version (today
`1.24.1`) via `uvx --from 'zizmor==1.24.1'`. To upgrade, open a PR
against this repository updating that pin and let the change ride out
through the normal review and PR-check process. Pinning protects
against unintended behaviour changes from upstream releases.

#### Promoting findings to merge-blocking

After the team triages the existing backlog of findings across the
organisation (auto-fixed via `zizmor --fix`, suppressed via inline
`# zizmor: ignore[rule]` comments, or addressed in a per-repo
`zizmor.yml` configuration), a **code-scanning ruleset** can promote
individual rules — or all rules at a chosen severity — to
merge-blocking:

1. Organisation settings → Repository → Rulesets → New ruleset →
   *New code scanning ruleset*.
2. Add `zizmor` (the SARIF *category*) as a tool, set the alert
   threshold to `error` (or the desired severity), and target the
   default branch.

Until an org admin completes that step, `zizmor` operates purely as a
reporting tool.

### Repository Audit Workflow

The `repo-audit.yaml` workflow:

1. Lists all repositories in the organisation via the GitHub API
2. Filters out repositories named in `excluded-repos.json`
3. Parses the profile README for documented repository links
4. Compares the two sets and identifies any undocumented repositories
5. Posts a summary to the GitHub Actions job output
6. Sends a Slack notification to `#releng-scm` if any updates need attention

The workflow requires:

- **`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`** — A repository secret containing a Slack bot
  token with `chat:write` permission for the
  `linuxfoundation.slack.com` workspace
- **`SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`** — A repository variable containing the channel
  ID for the `#releng-scm` channel

See the [Slack setup instructions](#slack-setup) below.

### Excluded Repositories

The `excluded-repos.json` file contains a JSON object with an
`excluded` array of repository names (not full paths) to skip
during the audit. Typical exclusions include:

- Forks of upstream actions (e.g. `gh-action-pypi-publish`)
- Repositories still at the template/placeholder stage
- Backup or archive directories

To add a new exclusion, edit `excluded-repos.json` and add the
repository name to the `excluded` array.

## Slack Setup

The repository audit workflow sends notifications using the official
[Slack GitHub Action](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action).
Complete the following one-time setup steps:

### 1. Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and sign in
   to the `linuxfoundation.slack.com` workspace
2. Click **Create New App** → **From scratch**
3. Name it `LF RelEng GitHub Notifications` (or similar)
4. Select the `linuxfoundation` workspace

### 2. Configure Bot Permissions

1. Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** in the app settings
2. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add:
   - `chat:write` — to post messages
   - `chat:write.customize` — to customise the bot name/icon per message
3. Click **Install to Workspace** and authorise the app
4. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)

### 3. Invite the Bot to the Channel

In Slack, open the `#releng-scm` channel and run:

```text
/invite @LF RelEng GitHub Notifications
```

### 4. Get the Channel ID

1. In Slack, right-click the `#releng-scm` channel name
2. Select **View channel details**
3. The Channel ID is at the bottom of the details panel (e.g.
   `C0123456789`)

### 5. Configure GitHub Secrets and Variables

In the [`.github` repository settings](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/.github/settings):

1. Go to **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add a **Repository secret**:
   - Name: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
   - Value: the `xoxb-` token from step 2
3. Add a **Repository variable**:
   - Name: `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`
   - Value: the channel ID from step 4
