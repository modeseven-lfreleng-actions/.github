# Linux Foundation Release Engineering

[Documentation](https://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/)

## GitHub Actions

The [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) Release Engineering
team maintains this organisation. It provides a comprehensive collection of
GitHub Actions and CI/CD tooling used across Linux
Foundation hosted projects.

All actions follow Conventional Commits, use pinned dependencies, and ship
with signed tags and provenance attestations.

## Building GitHub Workflows

The actions published here are designed for projects using both
GitHub and Gerrit as the source of code/truth. They all work in
native GitHub environments, and can also be used in Gerrit
environments with some adaptation to the workflows.

Workflow adaptation for Gerrit is documented in the
[gerrit-to-platform documentation][gerrit-to-platform-docs].
Some [example workflows][gerrit-to-platform-examples] are also
available.

### Example Workflows

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Workflow                                                 | Description                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`github-vanilla-verify.yaml`][wf-github-vanilla]        | A simple workflow that verifies PRs with no Gerrit integration        |
| [`gerrit-verify.yaml`][wf-gerrit-verify]                 | A workflow with Gerrit integration that verifies pull requests        |
| [`gerrit-verify-manual-dispatch.yaml`][wf-gerrit-manual] | A Gerrit integrated verify workflow that can also be manually invoked |
| [`gerrit-merge.yaml`][wf-gerrit-merge]                   | A GitHub workflow that handles merged changes in Gerrit               |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Tagging and Releasing Actions

### Prerequisites

1. Merge all open/pending pull requests
2. Sync your fork with upstream:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

``` shell
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
git push origin main
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### Creating a release

Create and push a signed, annotated tag:

``` shell
git tag -s -a v1.2.3 -m "v1.2.3"
git push upstream v1.2.3
```

The tag push triggers one of two release workflows:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Workflow                  | Use case                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `tag-push.yaml`           | Generic (non-language-specific) actions |
| `build-test-release.yaml` | Python actions that publish to PyPI     |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

> **Note:** These workflows live in each action repository,
> not in this `.github` repo.

#### Generic action/repository (`tag-push.yaml`)

Verifies the tag is valid semver then promotes the
corresponding draft GitHub release.

#### Python action/repository (`build-test-release.yaml`)

Runs the full Python release pipeline:

1. Tag format and signature validation
2. Python build with Sigstore signing and attestations
3. Pytest test suite
4. SBOM generation and Grype vulnerability scan
5. pip-audit for known security issues
6. Publish to test.pypi.org then pypi.org
7. Attach build artefacts to the GitHub release
8. Promote the draft release

> **Note:** Release workflows for other language types
> (Go, Maven, etc.) still need authoring.
